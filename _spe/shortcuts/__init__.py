"""How to define your own keyboard shortcuts:
Define a dictionary with the shortcuts you want to override. The following rules
apply:
- symbols '&' and '.' are omitted (eg 'Go to line',not '&Go to line...')
- labels are case sensitive (eg 'Go to line',not 'go to line')
- spaces are sensitive (eg 'Go to line', not 'GoTo line')

See 'Macintosh.py' as an example."""
